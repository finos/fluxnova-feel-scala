# FEEL Scala

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.finos.fluxnova.feel/feel-engine/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.finos.fluxnova.feel/feel-engine)

**Needs Review:**
A parser and interpreter for FEEL that is written in Scala (see [What is FEEL?](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/feel/)).

The FEEL engine started as a slack time project, grown into a community-driven project, and is now officially maintained by [Fluxnova](https://fluxnova.finos.org/). :rocket: 

It is integrated in the following projects:
* [Fluxnova](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/feel/) as part of the DMN engine

**Features:** :sparkles:

* Full support for unary-tests and expressions 
* Including built-in functions
* Extensible by custom functions and object mappers

## Usage 

Please have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/feel/). It describes how to write FEEL expressions (e.g. data types, language constructs, builtin-functions, etc.). Or, check out examples and learning resources [here](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-feel-scala/tree/main/docs/docs/learn).

Want to try it out? Use the [Playground](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-feel-scala/tree/main/docs/docs/playground) to evaluate FEEL expressions. 

## Install and Extend

Please have a look at the [developer documentation](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-feel-scala/tree/main/docs/docs/developer-guide). It describes how to integrate the engine into your application, and how to extend/customize it.
